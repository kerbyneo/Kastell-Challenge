This is the base template to use to make a game as your take home project.

It contains the features for:

	First Person Camera control with mouse.
	Walk (WASD)
	Jump (Space bar)

There's only 3 requirements that the game needs to fulfill:
1) Win condition
2) Lose condition
3) The game must be in first person view

Other than that you are free to make any kind game you want.

You are strongly advised to make use of the KinematicBody script provided for anything movement or physics related.

If you want to learn more about it, you can follow the doc: [Kinematic Body script Doc](https://github.com/gflores/CreateAGameChallenge/wiki)

As mentioned, BaseCharacterController provides walking, jumping, and air control, but it doesn't mean they have to appear in the final game.
They are there as a starting point on how basic features can be done using KinematicBody, but feel free to change (or remove) them, or create new ones as you need.
It's also fine to not add any new controls and just use those just a provided. You can still adjust the public variables in the editor.

The game will be rated on 3 metrics:

## Fun Factor
How "Fun" is the game? Does it hold attention, is it compelling, interesting, intriguing, exciting, etc... ?
How much pleasure, awe, or emotions are derived from playing the game?

## Polish
How good and "professional" does it look? Is it stylish, would people comment it's "beautiful", and does it look finished?
Would it look good in a trailer? 
Putting the gameplay game length aside, does it look like a 5-stars game?

## Length and Replayability
What would make a gamer want to play the game for an extended period of time?
Are the mechanics deep and rewarding enough to practice and master? Are there things to explore, learn and discover?
For this test, I'm not just looking on how long the actual game takes to complete, but also looking at what the game length **could** be if it were to be expended.
		
### Choose only one of the two category of challenge you want to pass
Each have their own rules and rating priorities.

## 1) Game Developer - Specialized in Game Design and Level Design
A project in this category will be rated based on those priority:

1) Fun factor: /10
2) Length and Replayability: /6
3) Polish: /4

An applicant in this category is free to use any third party asset they wish. Any sources is OK.
	
**What I'm looking for:**

	A good concept that plays well, and that has potential.
	I should feel that with more dev and production time it could become a real game that plays for 4-8hrs.
	The polish level doesn't need to be high, just "OK" is enough. As long as it doesn't look "bad", it's fine.
	Try to aim for atleast 8 minutes engaging gameplay.

## 2) Game Developer - Specialized in 3D asset creation and Polishing.
A project in this category will be rated based on those priority:

1) Polish: /12
2) Fun factor: /6
3) Length and Replayability: /2

An applicant in this category must create all 3D assets by themselves.
(It doesn't include animations, so feel free to use Mixamo or others if you want to)

**What I'm looking for:**

	A demo that looks good.
	It should look like a polished vertical slice, imagine if you were to make a trailer out of it.
	The gameplay should just be decent, atleast not outright boring.
	Try to aim for atleast 3 minutes engaging gameplay.



# Additional Notes

Here's how the play-session will go:

- When your game is ready, we will schedule a timing where you will present your game and I will play it.

- In the play session, you can spend about 5 minutes showing me the game, playing it yourself, and show me what you want me to see/know.
You can think of it as a live trailer.

- After your live presentation I will play the game for 5 to 15 minutes.

- Then we will open your Unity project and you can explain how everything works.

Please schedule the play-session atleast a day before the actual day.

Please do not add any sound effect or music to the game.


Also you must use the version **2020.3.6 of Unity**.

To install it, you can visit this page [https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.6](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.6) then click "Install this version with Unity Hub".

Make sure you have Unity Hub installed beforehand.

Good luck and have fun!
